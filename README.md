![Canine Music Logo](https://github.com/Aurailus/CanineMusic/blob/master/resources/canine_logo_raster_small.png)

A clean, lightweight Music Player for Android.

## What is Canine Music?
Canine Music is a Java App made by [@Aurailus](https://github.com/Aurailus) for Android Devices, with help from [@delta1512](https://github.com/delta1512). The app aims to achieve everything that we've wanted that other music apps have omitted. The app is being built in Android Studio for API 14 (Android Kitkat (NEW!!)) and up.

## What needs to be done:
- [x] Music Playback
- [x] Album Arts
- [ ] Shuffle
- [ ] Jumble
- [ ] Playlists
- [ ] Web integration (Soundcloud, Youtube??)
- [ ] ID3 Editor
- [ ] Volume button jacking

## Will it cost money?
No, Canine Music will be provided free of charge.

## How can I help?
I don't know how Github works, Don't ask me!
