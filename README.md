A Lightweight and clean Music Player for Android.

## What is Canine Music?
Canine Music is a Java App made by me, @Aurailus for Android Devices, with help from @delta1512. The app aims to achieve everything that I've wanted that other music apps have omitted. The app is being built in Android Studio for API 21 (Android Lollipop) and up.

## What needs to be done:
- [x] Music Playback
- [ ] Album Arts
- [ ] Shuffle
- [ ] Jumble
- [ ] Playlists
- [ ] Web integration (Soundcloud, Youtube??)
- [ ] ID3 Editor
- [ ] Volume button jacking

## Will it cost money?
No, Canine Music will be provided free of charge.

## How can I help?
I don't know how Github works, Don't ask me!
